## Note:
- This is not mobile resposive website as of now(made for desktop)

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


## What I learned
- I learned how to arrange components with flexbox, I learned how to stick the image to the left margin here, and since this was my first time working with svg, I learned about fill and other svg-related properties while working on this home page.

## Time taken
- It took me around 3 hours to built this website from scratch.
